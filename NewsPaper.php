                    <p> The Rwandan government has shut down thousands of churches and mosques for failing to meet safety, 
                        hygiene, and noise regulations. The Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) cited issues like poor infrastructure, 
                        lack of sanitation, and unqualified leaders. Since 2018, over 8,000 religious institutions have been 
                        closed, with authorities insisting that compliance is necessary for public safety. While some see this 
                        as a crackdown on religious freedom, the government argues it promotes responsible worship. Religious
                         groups can reopen if they meet the requirements, but the move has sparked debate over the balance
                          between regulation and faith in Rwanda.

                        <p>Since February 2018, Rwanda has witnessed an <span class="highlight-text">unprecedented crackdown on churches</span>, with authorities shutting down over 8,000 places of worship nationwide, including more than 700 in Kigali alone (Word & Way, Anglican Ink).</p>

                          Is this a bold step toward order and accountability, or a suppression of religious freedom? The debate rages on.

                        <p>Citing safety violations, poor hygiene, and excessive noise, the government insists these closures are necessary to protect the public and enforce regulations that now require religious leaders to have formal theological training (ACI Africa).</p>
                        
                        <p>However, for many Rwandans, these measures feel like an attack on faith, forcing small congregations out of their worship spaces and raising concerns about the government's increasing control over religion.</p>
