                    <p> The Rwandan government has shut down thousands of churches and mosques for failing to meet safety, 
                        hygiene, and noise regulations. The Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) cited issues like poor infrastructure, 
                        lack of sanitation, and unqualified leaders. Since 2018, over 8,000 religious institutions have been 
                        closed, with authorities insisting that compliance is necessary for public safety. While some see this 
                        as a crackdown on religious freedom, the government argues it promotes responsible worship. Religious
                         groups can reopen if they meet the requirements, but the move has sparked debate over the balance
                          between regulation and faith in Rwanda.

            As of 2025, Rwanda continues to play a crucial role in supporting Mozambique's fight against terrorism,
             particularly in the conflict-stricken Cabo Delgado region. Since deploying troops in July 2021, Rwanda
              has worked alongside Mozambican forces to reclaim key territories from insurgent groups, restoring
               security and enabling thousands of displaced citizens to return home. This ongoing military intervention
                demonstrates Rwanda's commitment to regional stability and security cooperation, setting an example of 
                African solidarity in addressing cross-border threats. The success of this mission underscores Rwanda's 
                growing influence in peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts across the continent.

        <p> French President Emmanuel Macron made a historic visit to Rwanda from May 27 to May 28, 2021, aiming to mend 
            the strained relations between the two countries due to France's involvement in the 1994 Genocide against the 
            Tutsi. During his visit, Macron acknowledged France's "overwhelming responsibility" in the genocide but 
            stopped short of issuing a formal apology. He stated that France had not been complicit but had made serious 
            errors in its judgment. Macron's visit included a meeting with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and a speech at
             the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where he expressed a commitment to building a new relationship between France 
             and Rwanda between regulation and faith in Rwanda.
